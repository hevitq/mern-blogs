## MERN BlOG

**MERN Blog** is a learning project about MERN Stack technology (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) implemented by [vnPace](https://vnpace.dev)

## Motivation

The project aims to learn about MERN Stack technology, and thereby develop into a project framework for both the frontend and the backend, with the following contents:

1. Create a standard code style.
2. Create documents that support code.
3. And some other things, updating...

## Build status

Coming soon...

## Code style

1. Use [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) to create standard comments.
2. Use Prettier, ESLintrc to format and check error code.
3. Use Markdownlint to write markdown documents.
4. Updating...

## Tech/framework used

<b>Built with</b>
MERN Stack

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/)
- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)

**Node React and NextJs** because they all use same programming language JavaScript. So even though it's a FullStack app with separate **API** and separate **frontend**, we will be dealing with only one language - JavaScript.

**NodeJs and Mongo DB** for building API because its incredibly easy, flexible and easy to scale.

**React** is extremely powerful, and recently became so much fun and easy to use with the introduction of **hooks**.

**NextJs** takes the development process of React apps to whole new level.

**NextJs** comes with SSR out of the box and **SSR** is necessary for **SEO**

**NextJs** automatically decides if your web page can be served as a **static page** or **dynamic page**. If your page is not making request to backend server to fetch data then NextJs automatically serves that page as **static page**. Static pages load extremely fast because they are static, so no need to wait for server response.

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Installation

Provide step by step series of examples and explanations about how to get a development env running.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## How to use?

If people like your project they’ll want to learn how they can use it. To do so include step by step guide to use your project.

## Contribute

Let people know how they can contribute into your project. A [contributing guideline](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-electron/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) will be a big plus.
