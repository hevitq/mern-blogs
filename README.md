## MERN BlOG

**MERN Blog** is a learning project about MERN Stack technology (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) implemented by [vnPace](https://vnpace.dev)

## Motivation

The project aims to learn about MERN Stack technology, and thereby develop into a project framework for both the frontend and the backend, with the following contents:

1. Create a standard code style.
2. Create documents that support code.
3. And some other things, updating...

## Build status

## Code style

1. Use [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) to create standard comments.
2. Use Prettier, ESLintrc to format and check error code.
3. Use Markdownlint to write markdown documents.
4. Updating...

## Tech/framework used

<b>Built with</b>
MERN Stack

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/)
- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)

**Node React and NextJs** because they all use same programming language JavaScript. So even though it's a FullStack app with separate **API** and separate **frontend**, we will be dealing with only one language - JavaScript.

**NodeJs and Mongo DB** for building API because its incredibly easy, flexible and easy to scale.

**React** is extremely powerful, and recently became so much fun and easy to use with the introduction of **hooks**.

**NextJs** takes the development process of React apps to whole new level.

**NextJs** comes with SSR out of the box and **SSR** is necessary for **SEO**

**NextJs** automatically decides if your web page can be served as a **static page** or **dynamic page**. If your page is not making request to backend server to fetch data then NextJs automatically serves that page as **static page**. Static pages load extremely fast because they are static, so no need to wait for server response.

## Installation

## API Reference

You can easy grab api reference by "View in Web" feature in the postman tool. I documented APIs clearly, even if you can easy to write a script for generate to a document as a excel file.

## Tests

I expect all code to be 100% covered by tests automatically. I will prepare some scripts for testing API with the Postman tools, and something like that. After that, I will cover my testing with the Selenium.

### Setup testing environment

You can easy to get your testing environment from the ./scripts folder.

#### Setup postman for testing API

What you need to do is get the postman script and import to your postman application or postman extension. I will write a markdown guideline, or create a short video, but at the moment you can contact to me if there is any problem when installing.

#### Setup selenium for automation testing

When coding completed, I will spend more time for making a guideline with automation testing by the selenium tool. I hope that I can cover 90% for this project, even if I must use some other tools or write some scrips.

## How to use?

I'm always trying take a note somethings related setting up development environment and write more comment to you can easy clear step-by-step a application development process.

### Setup editor

Basically you can use any editor for development in this project. But I'm coding by the **VSCode** tool, so anything related to formatting, guideline, tips & tricks, resolving bugs will be easy implement if you make it similarly. There is a reason I choose the VScode that I can easy grab any configuration and run it from command-line in windows, linux, mac os with no big difference.

You can grab some scripts for creating your editor in vscode scripts. It will help you save more time instead of manually setup. But, I also think that you can wanna customize that, so I will try write a guideline for using extension and configuration.

### Setup project configuration

When you clone this project, you should spend a few time for reading README, CHANGELOG file. Step-by-step in development process, I tried write in those carefully.

Before I can complete a good development guideline, you can grab anything related it through commit log with a Version Control Software like **Git**, **Source Tree**. I'm using Git command-line to save time when working with repository, but I also use Source Tree to easy grab more information visually.

### Setup software development tool

I will tracking any thing by JIRA tool when setting CI/CD process.

### Setup cloud

I will step-by-step guide how to deploy this project to the **Digital Ocean Cloudflare**.

## Contribute
